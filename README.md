Investigate the efficiency various neural network architectures

Developed a deep learning pipeline using CNNs to evaluate kidney donor quality from NHS-scored medical images (scale 0â€“5), enhancing transplant decision-making.

Engineered and extracted key image features using multiple CNN architectures; optimized performance through data augmentation and pre-processing techniques.

Trained and compared classifiers (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) on CNN-derived features to accurately predict surgeon-assigned donor suitability scores.
